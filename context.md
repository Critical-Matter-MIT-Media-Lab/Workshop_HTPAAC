### Design Features

#### Visual Design

- Dark theme background (#000)
- Deep pink color scheme (#FF1493)
- Glass morphism effects and smooth animations
- Responsive design for mobile devices

#### Unique Revolver Progress Indicator

- 17 chambers corresponding to 17 slides
- Rotating animation showing current progress
- Appears on mouse movement, auto-hides after 1 second
- Clickable chambers for direct slide navigation

#### Multiple Interaction Methods

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys, Space, Enter, number keys 1-9, ESC, P key
- **Mouse Navigation**: Click left half for previous, right half for next
- **Touch Support**: Swipe gestures for slide transitions
- **Auto-play**: Toggle with P key

### Target Audience

- Electronic engineers and designers
- Makers and DIY enthusiasts
- Students and educators
- Technical professionals interested in circuit prototyping

### Content Update Policy

**Important**: All text content will be manually updated by the user. Developers should not proactively edit slide content unless explicitly requested by the user.

### Usage Instructions

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Navigate using various input methods
3. Mouse movement reveals progress indicator
4. Supports full-screen presentation mode

### Development Notes

- Maintain code maintainability
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Optimize loading performance
- Preserve responsive design
